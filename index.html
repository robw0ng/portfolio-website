            &emsp;&emsp;Hi, I'm Robert! I'm a software engineer based in the NYC/Long Island area. 
            I am currently a Stony Brook University student on track to graduate in December 2025. 
            I love tackling challenges and learning new things. I am always looking for new opportunities to grow and improve.
            In my free time, I enjoy drawing, painting, sewing, running, and skateboarding.
            I have experience with many different technologies and programming languages. 
            I have been coding ever since I received my first computer. 
            My love for technology came from my curiosity to learn.
            I love creating things, and nowadays, coding and technology have made their way into every field imaginable.
            I love the freedom of being able to create anything I want, and I love the satisfaction of seeing my projects come to life.

            &emsp;&emsp;I would describe myself as a hardworking, dedicated, and passionate individual. 
            I love joking around and creating a fun environment. 
            My main goal is to be able to work in a place where I can express myself creatively and be surrounded by people who are just as passionate about their work as I am.
            I think it's important to be unique and to embrace your individuality, and I try to bring that mindset into everything I do.
            I could go on and on about my interests and hobbies, but I think it's best if you get to know me in person!
            Please feel free to reach out through my contact page if you have any questions.
            Thank you for taking the time to get to know me!
        </p>
