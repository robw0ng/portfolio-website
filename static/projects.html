        <h1>NameCube: A GameCube BIOS Clone</h1>
        <h3>(May 2024 - June 2024)</h3>
        <h2><b>Overview:</b></h2>
        <p><b>NameCube</b> is a clone of the BIOS screen from the Nintendo GameCube. It is not an exact clone, however it is a recreation of an interactive floating cube in space. One can interact with the multiple faces of the cube and it will move and bounce around. It exclusivley uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to handle the 3D movement. I did this as a way to challenge myself, using math to achieve my goal. Additionally, I included my contact information to use the site as a mini-portfolio website. Anyone visiting the site can interact with the cube and learn about who I am.</p>
